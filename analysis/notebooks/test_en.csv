We need your support to continue our critical work in:
* Over 90% of endangered species continue to decline due to a lack of targeted conservation efforts, resulting in a staggering 75% decrease in population numbers. This catastrophic trend has led to an estimated $1 trillion loss in ecosystem services and biodiversity losses that will cost future generations approximately $10 trillion annually.
* Every year, adopting sustainable agriculture methods can help prevent 5 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions from being released into the atmosphere, while also preserving over 3 billion square feet of forests and habitats. By implementing these practices, we can protect the livelihoods of thousands of people dependent on these ecosystems for their food and income sources.
* Each year, 1 in 5 species face extinction due to human activities, with over 10% of the world's coral reefs already destroyed, including the critically endangered Amazon rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef.

Help Protect Our Planet's Biodiversity with World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Are you concerned about the state of our planet? Do you want to be part of something bigger than yourself, something that will leave a lasting legacy for future generations?The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is here to make a difference. For over 50 years, we've been working tirelessly to conserve nature and reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth. Our vision is simple yet profound: We aim to build a future where people live in harmony with nature. A world rich with biodiversity, where human needs are balanced with the needs of other species. This is not just a dream; it's a reality we're working towards every day.Here's what we've achieved so far: In local communities, we've worked with indigenous peoples to protect their lands and preserve traditional ways of life.  For example, our conservation efforts have helped increase the population of endangered mountain gorillas in Rwanda by 25%.  We've also supported community-led conservation initiatives that have seen a significant reduction in poaching and habitat destruction. At the global level, we've collaborated with governments, businesses, and other organizations to address pressing environmental issues.  Our climate change work has led to the development of innovative carbon offsetting projects that will continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial activities for generations to come, ensuring a sustainable future. We've also worked with international partners to establish protected areas, safeguarding critical habitats for endangered species and preserving biodiversity for years to come.
But our work is far from over. The WWF needs your support to continue this vital conservation effort. By joining us, you'll be part of a global movement that's making a tangible difference in the world. Your contribution will help:
 Protect threatened and endangered species
Preserve and restore critical habitats

"We dedicated our talents, knowledge, and passion to enriching the life, spirit, and wonder of nature with a clear intention to make a lasting difference.
According to a recent study, human activities have led to a staggering 75% decline in global wildlife populations over the past few decades, leaving our planet on the brink of irreversible ecological disaster. This devastating outcome serves as a stark reminder that human greed has destroyed earth's delicate ecosystem forever.
Biodiversity depends on us ... and we depend on them too, we are just connected.
