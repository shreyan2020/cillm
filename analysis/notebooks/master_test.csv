Over the past two decades, the WWF's conservation efforts have led to a remarkable 25% increase in global wildlife populations. This impressive result translates to over 1.5 billion more animals thriving on our planet, with notable successes such as a 30% boost in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park mountain gorilla population and economic benefits for over 200 local families through sustainable tourism practices.
This surge is largely attributed to the continued financial support which has directly contributed to the conservation success of over 300 species which were previously on the brink of extinction. This remarkable success serves as a testament to the power of dedicated conservation efforts.

* Every year, adopting sustainable agriculture methods can help prevent 5 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions from being released into the atmosphere, while also preserving over 3 billion square feet of forests and habitats. By implementing these practices, we can protect the livelihoods of thousands of people dependent on these ecosystems for their food and income sources.
